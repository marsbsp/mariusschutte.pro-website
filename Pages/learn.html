                                    I recently earned a degree accredited by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), which I pursued with the intention of becoming a chartered accountant.

                                    <br><br>

                                    This decision followed careful consideration, as I realized during my previous studies that my true passion lay in accounting. Consequently, I made the strategic choice to transition from a degree in Financial Management to this specialized program in order to fully align with my long-term career aspirations.
